# About

# Workflow
Our team used Agile workflow for this sprint.

## Trello
A Trello board was used to create and track tickets.  We held daily scrum meetings to discuss accomplishments, challenges, and upcoming tickets.  To effectively collaborate remotely while allowing for quick communication if needed, we utilized Discord, Slack, and Zoom.

## Version Control
We implemented Git Feature Branch Workflow.  All pull requests in Github were reviewed by another team member before being merged into the main branch.

# Development

## Repo
`git clone https://github.com/hratx-blue-ocean/adriatic-common-ground`

## Install
`npm install`

## Start Scripts
```
npm start
npm run build
```

## Google Maps API Key

To properly render the map in the details page, you must create a Google Maps API token and place it into file named config.js in the src folder.

To create an API key:

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/apiui/credential
2. On the credentials page, click Create credentials > API Key.
    The API key created dialog displays your newly created API key.
3. Click Close.
    The new API key is listed on the Credentials page under API keys.
    (Remember to restrict the API key before using it in production.)
